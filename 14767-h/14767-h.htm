    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>Count BERNSTORFF, it appears, was very much annoyed with the
    way in which certain Americans are supporting President WILSON,
    and he decided to read them a lesson they would not soon
    forget. So he left America.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Things are certainly settling down a little in Hungary. Only
    two shots were fired at Count TISZA in the Hungarian Diet last
    week.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The famous Liquorice Factory which has figured so often in
    the despatches from Kut is again in the hands of our troops.
    Bronchial subjects who have been confining themselves to black
    currant lozenges on patriotic grounds will welcome the
    news.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The German Imperial Clothing Department has decreed that
    owners of garments "bearing the marks of prodigal eating" will
    not be permitted to replace them, and the demand among the
    elderly dandies of Berlin for soup-coloured waistcoats is said
    to have already reached unprecedented figures.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"On the Western front," says <i>The Cologne Gazette</i>,
    "the British are defeated." Some complaints are being made by
    the Germans on the spot because they have not yet been
    officially notified of the fact.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A neutral diplomat in Vienna has written for a sack of rice
    to a colleague in Rome, who, feeling that the Austrians may be
    on the look-out for the rice, intends to defeat their hopes by
    substituting confetti.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>By the way the FOOD CONTROLLER may shortly forbid the use of
    rice at weddings. We have long held the opinion that as a
    deterrent the stuff is useless.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"The British," says the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i>, "what are
    they? They are snufflers, snivelling, snorting, shirking,
    snuffling, vain-glorious wallowers in misery...." It is thought
    likely that the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> is vexed with us.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Count PLUNKETT, although elected to the House of Commons,
    will not attend. It is cruel, but the COUNT is convinced that
    the punishment is no more severe than the House deserves.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A North of England Tribunal has just given a plumber
    sufficient extension to carry out a large repair job he had in
    hand. This has caused some consternation among those who
    imagined that the War would end this year.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Lord DEVONPORT'S weekly bread allowance is regarded as
    extravagant by a lady correspondent, who writes, "In my own
    household we hardly eat any bread at all. We practically live
    on toast."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>An informative contemporary explains that the Chinese eggs
    now arriving are nearly all brown and resemble those laid in
    this country by the Cochin China fowl. This, however, is not
    the only graceful concession to British prejudice, for the
    eggs, we notice, are of that oval design which is so popular in
    these islands.</p>

    <hr class="short" />

    <p>An <i>Evening News</i> correspondent states that at one
    restaurant last week a man consumed "a large portion of beef,
    baked potatoes, brussels-sprouts, two big platefuls of bread,
    apple tart, a portion of cheese, a couple of pats of butter and
    a bottle of wine." We understand that he would also have
    ordered the last item on the menu but for the fact that the
    band was playing it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Carmelite sleuth at a City restaurant reports that one
    "Food Hog" had for luncheon "half-a-dozen oysters, three slices
    of roast beef with Yorkshire pudding, two vegetables and a
    roll." The after-luncheon roll is of course the busy City man's
    substitute for the leisured club-man's after-luncheon nap.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>There is plenty of coal in London, the dealers announce, for
    those who are willing to fetch it themselves. Purchasers of
    quantities of one ton or over should also bring their own paper
    and string.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>One of the rarest of British birds, the great bittern, is
    reported to have been seen in the Eastern counties during the
    recent cold spell. In answer to a telephonic inquiry on the
    matter Mr. POCOCK, of the Zoological Gardens, was heard to
    murmur, "Once bittern, twice shy."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A stoker, prosecuted at a London Police Court for carrying
    smoking materials into a munitions factory, explained in
    defence that no locker had been assigned to him. The Bench
    thereupon placed one at his disposal for a period of one
    month.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>On the Somme, says <i>The Times</i>, the New Zealand
    Pioneers, consisting of Maoris, Pakehas and Raratongans, dug
    13,163 yards of trenches, mostly under German fire. The really
    thrilling fact about this is that we have enlisted the sympathy
    of the Pakehas (or "white men"), who, with the single exception
    of the Sahibs of India, are probably the fiercest tribe in our
    vast Imperial possessions.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The announcement that the Scotland Yard examination will not
    be lowered for women taxicab drivers has elicited a number of
    inquiries as to whether "language" is a compulsory or an
    alternative subject.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"The feathers are most quickly got rid of by removing them
    with the skin," says the writer of a recently published letter
    on "Sparrows as Food." He forgets the very considerable economy
    which can be achieved by having them baked in their
    jackets.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We are glad to note an agitation for a bath-room in every
    artisan dwelling. Only last week we were pained by a photograph
    in a weekly paper showing somebody reduced to taking his tub in
    the icy Serpentine.</p>

    <p>We can well understand Mr. LAW'S sense of loneliness, and

    <h2>HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.</h2>

    <p class="center">(<i>The PRESIDENT of the United States and
    Mr. GERARD.</i>)</p>

    <p><i>The President.</i> Here you are then at last, my dear Mr.
    GERARD. I am afraid you have had a long and uncomfortable
    journey.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Gerard.</i> Don't say a word about that, Mr.
    President. It's all in the day's work, and, anyhow, it's an
    immense pleasure to be back in one's own country.</p>

    <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, I can well believe that. Living
    amongst Germans at this time can be no satisfaction to an
    American citizen.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. G.</i> No, indeed, Mr. President; you never said a
    truer word than that in your life. The fact is the Germans have
    all gone mad with self-esteem, and are convinced that every
    criticism of their actions must have its foundations in envy
    and malignity. And yet they feel bitterly, too, that, in spite
    of their successes here and there, the War on the whole has
    been an enormous disappointment for them, and that the longer
    it continues the worse their position becomes. The mixture of
    these feelings makes them grossly arrogant and sensitive to the
    last degree, and reasonable intercourse with them becomes
    impossible. No, Mr. President, they are not pleasant people to
    live amongst at this moment, and right glad am I to be away
    from them.</p>

    <p><i>The President.</i> And as to their submarine warfare, do
    they realise that we shall hold them to what they have
    promised, and that if they persist in their policy of murder
    there must be war between them and us?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. G.</i> The certainty that you mean what you say has
    but little effect on them. They argue in this way: Germany is
    in difficulties; the submarine weapon is the only one that will
    help Germany, therefore Germany must use that weapon ruthlessly
    and hack through with it, whatever may be urged on behalf of
    international law or humanity at large. Humanity doesn't count
    in the German mind because humanity doesn't wear a German
    uniform or look upon the KAISER as absolutely infallible. Down,
    therefore, with humanity and, incidentally, with America and
    all the smaller neutrals who may be disposed to follow her
    lead.</p>

    <p><i>The President.</i> So you think patience, moderation and
    reasonable argument are all useless?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. G.</i> See here, Mr. President, this is how the
    matter stands. They imagine they can ruin England with their
    submarines&mdash;they 're probably wrong, but that's their
    notion&mdash;but if they give way to America this illegitimate
    weapon is blunted and they lose the war. Sooner than suffer
    that catastrophe they will defy America. And they don't believe
    as yet that America means what she says and is determined to
    fight rather than suffer these outrages to continue. The
    Germans will try to throw dust in your eyes, Mr. President,
    while continuing the submarine atrocities.</p>

    <p><i>The President.</i> The Germans will soon be undeceived.
    We will not suffer this wrong, and we will fight, if need be,
    in order to prevent it. God knows we have striven to keep the
    peace through months and years of racking anxiety. If war comes
    it is not we who have sought it. Nobody can lay that reproach
    upon us. Rather have we striven by all honourable means to
    avoid it. But we have ideals that we cannot abandon, though
    they may clash with German ambitions and German methods. There
    we are fixed, and to give way even by an inch would be to
    dishonour our country and to show ourselves unworthy of the
    freedom our forefathers won for us at the point of the sword.
    That is the conclusion I have come to, having judged these
    matters with such power of judgment as God has given me.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. G.</i> And to that every true American will say
    Amen.</p>

    wasted out here; all the best people are out-of-doors all the
    time. For myself, with thirty degrees of frost about, it seemed
    to be the exact moment to slip over to England and help keep
    the home fires burning.</p>

    <p>Accordingly I repaired to a neighbouring port, and when I
    got there an officer, who appeared to be looking for something,
    asked me what my rank was. In peace times I should have loved a
    little unexpected sympathy like this; as a soldier, quite an
    old soldier now, I dislike people who take an interest in me,
    especially if they have blue on their hats. I thanked him very
    much for his kind inquiry, but indicated that my lips were
    sealed. His curiosity thereupon became positively acute; he
    was, he said, a man from whom it was impossible to keep a
    secret. He still wished to know what my rank was. I said it all
    depended which of them he was referring to, since there are
    three in all, the "Acting," the "Temporary" and the Rock-bottom
    one. In any case, at heart I was and always should remain a
    plain civilian mister. Should we leave it at that, and let
    bygones be bygones? He was meditating his answer, when I asked
    him if he realised how close he was standing to the edge of the
    quay, and when he turned round and looked I also turned round
    and went....</p>

    <p>The fellow who was standing next to me all this time was
    either too young or too proud to conceal his stars beneath an
    ordinary waterproof. Blue-hat didn't need to ask him what his
    rank was; he recognized at a glance just the very type of
    officer he was looking for. So he led off the poor fellow to
    the slaughter, and put him in charge of two hundred N.C.O.s and
    men proceeding on leave to the U.K. I've no doubt the fellow
    spent the best part of his days on the other side trying to get
    rid of his party. I have not been two years in France without
    discovering that you simply cannot be too careful when you are
    attempting to get out of it.</p>

    <p>When I reached England my feelings with regard to myself
    changed. I was no longer reticent about my rank. I displayed my
    uniform in a public restaurant, without any reserve. In
    consequence they'd only let me eat three-and-sixpence worth for
    my first meal. This time I was not so clever, it appeared, as I
    thought. I had erroneously supposed that by not being a
    civilian I should get more than two courses. As it was I got
    less, and so it was with a full heart and an empty stomach that
    I fell in for home. If I'd known I should have kept my
    waterproof on for luncheon.</p>

    <p>Do you realise how dismal a thing it is for us to be
    separated from our own by a High Sea all these months and
    years? It ain't fair, Sir, it simply ain't fair. In my case
    there is not only a wife amongst wives, but also a son amongst
    sons. Now, Charles, I am the very last person to call a thing
    good merely because it is my own, nor am I that kind of fool
    who thinks all his geese are swans. If my son had a fault I
    should be the very first to notice and call attention to it.
    But he has not; dispassionately and from an entirely detached
    and impersonal view, I am bound to say that there is about him
    an outstanding merit which at once puts him on a different
    level from all others. It isn't so much his four and a half
    teeth I'm thinking of, nor is it the twenty-seven overgrown and
    badly managed hairs which wander about at the back of his bald
    head and give him the look of a dissipated monk. It is just his
    intrinsic worth, clearly evidenced in everything about him.
    Obviously a man of parts, he has brains, a stout heart and an
    unfailing humour. Blessed with a keen perception, he delights
    those who can understand him with his singularly happy and apt
    turn of speech. You will, I think, accept my word as an officer
    and a gentleman that he <i>is</i> unique.</p>

    <p>Anticipating the welcome greeting of my wife and many
    pleasant hours to be spent in discussing with my son the things
    which matter, I put on all my waterproofs, gave the porter a
    twenty-five centime piece, which he mistook for a shilling,
    even as earlier on I had myself been led to mistake it for a
    franc, and hastened home.</p>

    <p>The welcome greeting seemed all right, but I had not been
    long in the company of my wife before I discovered that Another
    had come between us. I had not been long with my son before I
    discovered who that Other was.... I determined to have it out
    with him at once. Feeling that the situation was one for
    tactics, I manoeuvred for position and, to get him entirely at
    a disadvantage, I surprised him in his bath and taxed him with
    his infamy. I addressed him more in sorrow than in anger. I
    told him I was well aware of his personal charm, but in this
    instance I was bound to comment unfavourably on the use he had
    made of it. The very last thing I had expected of him was that
    at, or indeed before, the early age of one he would be stealing
    the affections of another man's wife.</p>

    <p>He was not ashamed or nonplussed; he was not even
    embarrassed by his immediate environment. In fact he turned it
    to his own advantage, for his hairs, duly watered and soaped
    down on to his cranium, lost their rakish look and gave him the
    appearance of a gentleman of perfect integrity, great intellect
    and no little financial stability. As between one man and
    another, he did not attempt to deny the truth of my assertion,
    gave me to understand, with a jovial smile, that such little
    incidents must always be expected as long as humanity remains
    human, and repudiated all personal responsibility in this
    instance. He even went so far as to suggest that it was the
    woman's fault; it was always she who was running after him, and
    his only offence had been that of being too chivalrous abruptly
    to repel her advances. I confess I was painfully surprised at
    the attitude he adopted; it consisted in putting his foot in
    one half <span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"
       id="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span> of his mouth and breathing
       stentorously through the other moiety. And when he started
       making eyes at the nurse I was too shocked to stay any
       longer.</p>

    <p>Never a man to take a thing sitting down, I waited till the
    next morning for my revenge. As the trustee of his future
    wealth I had him in my power. Stepping across to the nearest
    bank I borrowed an immense sum of money in his name and passed
    it all on to the Government, then and there, to be spent,
    <i>inter alia</i>, on the B.E.F. And what's more, I told him to
    his face that I'd done it. What reply do you suppose he made?
    He merely called for a drink.</p>

    <p>However, my revenge did not end there. On my way back to
    France I seized the opportunity of looking in at Cox's and
    there took back from the Government for my own sole and
    absolute use some of those very pounds my son had borrowed from
    the bank to give it. But I lost in the end, for my wife, whom I
    had taken with me to witness her and his discomfiture, had all
    the money off me again, in order, I gather, to put it in my
    son's money-box, for him to rattle now and spend later. The
    only result of my efforts therefore was to land me in a
    financial transaction so complicated that I cannot even follow
    it myself.</p>

    <h2>THE HARDSHIPS OF BILLETS.</h2>

    <p class="center">II.</p>

    <p>Nobody knows the misery of bein' lapped in luxury in a
    billet better than me and Jim. Mrs. Dawkins, as I told you,
    give us the best of everything in the 'ouse and our lives
    wasn't worth livin' owin' to Mr. Dawkins and the little
    Dawkinses and a young man lodger takin' against us in
    consekence. Seein' that they 'adn't a bed between 'em while we
    was given one apiece and their end of the table had next to
    nothin' on when ours was weighed down with sausages and
    suchlike, it were not surprisin' that Mr. Dawkins and the
    lodger swore at us and the little Dawkinses put their tongues
    out. But it were upsettin', and Jim and me did 'ope when we was
    moved to Mrs. Larkins's that we had a better time in store.</p>

    <p>"Just goin' to the Front, ain't they, poor fellows?" she
    said to the billetin' orficer. "I'll do my best by 'em. Nobody
    wouldn't like to coddle 'em better than I should, but 'twould
    be crule kindness to 'em, I knows. If 'ardships are in store
    for 'em let 'em 'ave a taste before they goes, I says, and it
    won't fall so 'eavy on 'em when they gets there."</p>

    <p>"There's as comfortable a feather bed as you could wish to
    sleep on ready and waitin' for you," she said to us, "but who
    with a woman's heart in her could put you on a feather bed
    knowin' you'll be sleepin' on the bare earth before three weeks
    is over your poor heads? I've put you a shake of straw on the
    floor for to-night. I'll take it away to-morrow so as you shall
    get used to the boards. I've wedged the winders top and bottom
    to make a draught through; that'll help you to bear the wind
    over there."</p>

    <p>It were a north-east wind, and it reglar took 'old of Jim.
    He's inclined to toothake, and in the mornin' his face were as
    big as a football. "I <i>am</i> thankful I thought of the
    winders," Mrs. Larkins said; "you'd 'ave suffered terrible if
    you'd 'ad the faceake for the first time in the trenches; now
    you'll get used to it before you gets there. A pepper plaster
    'ud ease you direckly, but you're goin' where there's no such
    things as pepper plasters, and it 'ud be a sin to let you taste
    the luxury of one over 'ere."</p>

    <p>Jim was for runnin' to the doctor to 'ave the tooth took
    out, but Mrs. Larkins wouldn't 'ear of it. "My poor fellow,"
    she said, "do you think a doctor'll come along with his
    pinchers all ready to take your tooth out in the trenches?
    You'll more like 'ave to do it yourself with a corkscrew. I'll
    lend you one willin'." But Jim said he wouldn't trouble her
    just at present, he was feelin' a little easier.</p>

    <p>She didn't cook us nothin' to eat. "My fingers itch to turn
    you out beyutiful dishes as your mouths 'ud water to come to a
    second time," she said, "but it 'ud be a crule kindness,
    knowin' you'll be fendin' for yourselves in a 'ole in the
    ground in three weeks' time. Better learn 'ow to do it now.
    There's a bit o' meat, and you can dig up any vegetables you
    fancy in the garden. I'll rake the fire out so as you shall
    learn 'ow to light a fire for yourselves; and I'll put the
    saucepans out of your way; it ain't likely you'll 'ave
    saucepans over there."</p>

    <p>We was never nearer starvin' than we was at Mrs. Larkins's.
    She said it made her heart bleed to see us, but we should be
    grateful to 'er one day for teachin' us 'ow to cook our vittels
    for ourselves or go without 'em.</p>

    <p>One of Jim's buttons come loose on his tunic and he asked
    Mrs. Larkins if she would be so kind as to sew it on for him.
    "Nothin' would please me better than to sew 'em all on, they're
    mostly 'angin' by a thread," she said; "but do you expect to
    find a woman in the trenches all 'andy to sew on your buttons?
    You'll 'ave to sew 'em on yourself, and the sooner you learn
    'ow to do it the better."</p>

    <p>We was accustomed to 'ave our washin' done for us in our
    other billets, but when the second Sunday come at Mrs.
    Larkins's and there wasn't no sign of a clean shirt we felt
    obliged to mention it to 'er. "'Ere's a bit o' soap and a
    bucket," she said, "and you knows where the well is."</p>

    <p>When we'd washed 'em we was goin' to 'ang 'em round the fire
    to dry; but she wouldn't 'ear of it. "Where'll you find a fire
    to dry 'em by over there?" she said; "you'll 'ave to wear 'em
    wet." And when we got the rheumatics she said, "Ah, a wet
    shirt's sure to do it. You'll never be without it over there.
    It's a mercy you've got a touch now. I shouldn't be sorry if I
    see you limpin' a bit more."</p>

    <p>It took us some time in the trenches to get over our
    'ardenin' at Mrs. Larkins's.</p>

        [The management of <i>The Times</i>, of which the price was
        raised on Monday to twopence, is anxious, in view of the
        paper famine, to restore the old custom by which this
        journal was subscribed for jointly or loaned, whether
        gratuitously or by newsagents at one penny a perusal.
        Having "determined to restrict the sale and encourage the

    <p class="center">BATTLE IN THE WEST-END.</p>

    <p>Piccadilly Circus was the scene of an appalling fracas this
    afternoon. Shortly after two o'clock a quietly-dressed
    middle-aged man, at present unidentified, was observed stealing
    cautiously from the Tube station with a thick wad of Treasury
    notes in one hand and <i>a copy of "The Times" in the
    other!</i> The sight of this latter seems to have sent several
    passers-by completely mad. The wretched stranger was instantly
    set upon, his journal torn from his hand and his limbs very
    severely mauled. The Treasury notes, unremarked in the fearful
    <i>m&eacute;l&eacute;e</i>, fell into the mud and were devoured
    by a passing Pekinese. Those now in possession of the priceless
    document were in turn set upon by others, until all Piccadilly
    Circus became a battlefield. The deplorable behaviour of
    motor-bus and taxicab drivers added greatly to the carnage, for
    these men, rendered frantic by the thought of the loot within
    their reach, repeatedly drove their vehicles into the seething
    mass of humanity in their efforts to acquire this unthinkable
    treasure. No official estimate of the casualties is yet to
    hand.</p>

    <p class="center">SOMETHING LIKE PATRIOTISM.</p>

    <p>A sterling example of patriotism has just come to the notice
    of the Rag and Bones Controller. A copy of <i>The Times</i>
    (including the Uruguay Supplement of 94 pages), issued four
    months ago, was purchased, under permit of the R. and B.
    Controller, by Baron Goldenschein, who read it from the top of
    col. 1, page 1, to the foot of col. 6, page 108. The entire
    household then read from col. 1, page 1, to col. 6, page 108.
    Baron Goldenschein tells us that his cook with difficulty could
    be persuaded to tear herself away from the Uruguay Supplement.
    All the tenants on the estate&mdash;some eighty
    souls&mdash;then enjoyed the paper, each tenant in turn posting
    it to relatives in various parts of the United Kingdom. At the
    end of three months it is estimated that over one thousand
    persons had read this copy of <i>The Times</i>. The Baron also
    informs us that each post brings him a fragment of the paper
    from remote parts of the country. When sufficient fragments
    have been collected and pasted together the whole will be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday, February 12th</i>.&mdash;Question-time, which
    towards the end of last Session was extended by a
    quarter-of-an-hour, to-day reverted to its old limits.
    Consideration for overworked officials was assigned as the
    reason, but I think the House as a whole was rather relieved at
    the disappearance of what was often a <i>triste quart
    d'heure</i>. One can easily have a surfeit of the piquant
    humours of Mr. GINNELL, Mr. KING and the rest of the <i>Rosa
    Dartles</i> of the House.</p>

    <p>The new Administration received some useful support from an
    unexpected quarter. Mr. MCKENNA, a little disturbed, perhaps,
    by the discovery that he had been a trifle of 350 millions out
    in his Budget estimate of the cost of the War, was fain to
    rebuke the Government for proposing two big Votes of Credit on
    one day. This unprecedented demand, he insisted, must have some
    dark purpose behind it. Were the Government contemplating a
    General Election? Mr. BONAR LAW quietly reminded him that
    exactly the same thing had been done this time last year when
    Mr. MCKENNA himself was at the Exchequer.</p>

    <p>"Luff, boy, luff," whispered Mr. ASQUITH to his discomfited
    lieutenant, who thereupon went off on another tack and
    proceeded to express doubts as to the wisdom of over-sea
    expeditions. But his course was again unfortunate. "Why did you
    go to Salonika?" interjected a voice from below the Gangway. As
    Major GODFREY COLLINS afterwards observed, neither the House
    nor the country will stand much criticism of the new Government
    by members of the old one.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, February 13th</i>.&mdash;Lord BERESFORD, in
    latter days heard with difficulty in the House of Commons, has
    found his voice again in the ampler air of the Gilded Chamber.
    His speech this afternoon on the submarine peril and how to
    defeat it might have wakened the echoes in the Admiralty at the
    far end of Whitehall. It evoked an admirable reply from Lord
    LYTTON, who, though not exactly a typical British tar in
    appearance, has evidently absorbed a full measure of the
    sea-spirit. Necessarily reticent as to the exact nature of the
    steps that are being taken to deal with the sea-highwaymen, he
    made the comforting announcement that already we had achieved
    very considerable success. This was endorsed by Lord CURZON,
    who revealed the interesting fact that he too is now a member
    of the Board of Admiralty, and was able to state that, after
    two years of "frightfulness," the British mercantile marine was
    only a small fraction below its tonnage at the
    commencement.</p>

    <p>The British revolution goes on apace. The Game Laws, over
    which so many Parliamentary battles have been fought, were
    swept away in a moment this afternoon when Captain BATHURST
    announced in his usual level tones that British farmers would
    in future be allowed to destroy pheasants with as little
    compunction as if they were rabbits, and with no regard to the
    sacredness of close-time.</p>

    <p>After this momentous announcement, which transforms (subject
    to the opinion of the law-officers) every tenant-farmer into a
    pheasant-proprietor, Members took a little time to recover
    their breath. But some of them were soon hard at work again
    heckling the Government over the multiplication of new
    departments and secretariats. Mr. SWIFT MACNEILL, whose
    reverence for the Constitution (save in so far as it applies to
    Ireland) knows no bounds, could hardly contain his fury at the
    setting up of a War Cabinet&mdash;"a body utterly unknown to
    the law"&mdash;and the inclusion therein of Ministers without
    portfolios but with salaries.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/126.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/126.png"
             alt="The Great Push." /></a> THE GREAT PUSH.
             CONGESTION ON THE TREASURY BENCH.
    </div>

    <p>He received a certain amount of rather gingerly support from
    Mr. RUNCIMAN and Mr. SAMUEL, who had evidently not forgotten
    what happened to Mr. MCKENNA yesterday. Mr. SAMUEL was a
    distinguished Member of a Government under which both the
    Ministry and the bureaucracy were swollen in peace-time to
    unprecedented size; but that did not prevent him from
    complaining that under the present <i>r&eacute;gime</i> the
    Administration had been further magnified until, if all its
    members, including Under-Secretaries, were present, they would
    fill not one but three Treasury Benches. Already it is a
    much-congested district at Question-time and is the daily scene
    of a Great Push.</p>

    <p>If underlying these criticisms there was a hope that they
    would draw the PRIME MINISTER from the seclusion of his private
    room, it was doomed to disappointment. Mr. BONAR LAW, asserting
    his position as Leader of the House, and not, as some people
    seemed to imagine, the PRIME MINISTER'S deputy, made a spirited
    defence of the new Ministerial arrangements as being essential
    for the conduct of the War, and challenged his opponents, if
    they wanted to make sure of the PRIME MINISTER'S presence, to
    move a Vote of Censure.</p>

    <p>At Question-time Mr. LAW had instructed the House how to
    discover the emblems on the new Treasury Note&mdash;the rose,
    the thistle, the shamrock and the daffodil (this last for
    Wales). On the Treasury Bench the daffodil is rarely to be
    descried; but the thistle is in full bloom all the time.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, February 14th</i>.&mdash;To-day the
    Vice-Chamberlain of the Household bore a message from the KING
    in reply to the Address. The House on these occasions is apt to
    be less interested in the message than in the messenger, and
    watches eagerly to see if he will trip in his backward march
    from the Chair, or forget one of the customary three bows. The
    present holder of the office does his work so featly and with
    such obvious enjoyment as to give a new significance to the
    phrase ... "With nods and BECKS and wreath&egrave;d
    smiles."</p>

    <p>Most of us only remember the late King THEBAW of Burma as a
    bloodthirsty and dissipated despot. It has been reserved for
    Sir JOHN REES to find a redeeming feature in his character.
    Among all his crimes, he never, it seems, prohibited the
    consumption of drink in his realm, though I fancy that his own
    efforts in that line considerably reduced the amount available
    for his subjects. Implored by the hon. Member not to turn Burma
    into a "dry" State, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN would say nothing more than
    that he declined (very properly) to take THEBAW as his
    model.</p>

    <p>No Leader of the House, perhaps, since Sir STAFFORD
    NORTHCOTE'S time <span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"
       id="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span> has occupied a more
       difficult position than Mr. BONAR LAW. But he is daily
       becoming more at home in the saddle, and can even venture
       upon a joke or two. Mr. PRINGLE opposed the suspension of
       the Eleven-o'clock Rule on the ground, <i>inter alia</i>,
       that "he only wanted to get away." "That," said Mr. LAW
       suavely, "is a result which can easily be attained," and the
       House, which is getting a little weary of Mr. PRINGLE'S
       frequent and acidulated interposition, noted his
       discomfiture with approving cheers.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, February 15th</i>.&mdash;Lord CURZON, in a
    happy phrase, described the late Duke of NORFOLK as "diffident
    about powers which were in excess of the ordinary." Is not that
    true of the British race as a whole? Only now, under the stress
    of a long-drawn-out conflict, is it discovering the variety and
    strength of its latent forces.</p>

    <p>There are, of course, exceptions to this rule&mdash;strong
    men who are fully conscious of their strength. Lord MIDLETON,
    for example, who sought a comprehensive return of all the
    buildings commandeered and staffs employed by the multifarious
    new Ministries, and was told that to provide it would put too
    great a strain on officials fully engaged on work essential to
    winning the War, promptly replied that if the Government would
    give him access to their books he would draw up a return in a
    couple of days. Either the evil has been greatly exaggerated or
    Lord MIDLETON is a super-statistician for whose services
    another hotel or two ought to be immediately secured.</p>

    <h2>THE ART OF DETACHMENT.</h2>

    <p class="center">(<i>Being a letter from a cloistered lady
    visiting London to her sister in the Shires.</i>)</p>

    <p>My dear Ruth,&mdash;Beginning at the beginning, let me tell
    you that you must at once go to the station to inquire how it
    is that they forced me to pay thirty shillings for my ticket,
    instead of one pound. Although the price one pound is printed
    on the ticket, I couldn't get it until I had paid ten shillings
    extra. There was no time to get a proper explanation, so I want
    you to do so. Very likely it is sheer blackmail by that man in
    the booking-office, whom I never cared for. You had better see
    the station-master about it.</p>

    <p>The next thing I want to tell you is that most of our ideas
    of London are wrong. You remember how we used to be told about
    its wonderful lighting at night, and the comfort of its hotels,
    and the bright shops, and the crowds of taxis, and so on. Well,
    this isn't true at all. So far from being well-lighted, I
    assure you that our few little streets and market square are a
    blaze compared with this city. Some streets here are absolutely
    dark, and even in the great thoroughfares there is so little
    light that crossing the road is most perilous. The thing could
    be put right in a moment if they would only see to it that the
    lamps were cleaned; I looked closely at several of them and I
    could see exactly what was wrong&mdash;a coat of grimy stuff
    has accumulated on the glass. Now to get this off would be
    quite easy, but it does not seem to have occurred to anyone to
    do it. I suppose that London is very badly managed; and here
    again I think the advantage lies with us, for I am certain that
    our District Council would never allow such a state of things.
    Probably the LORD MAYOR is lazy.</p>

    <p>The funny thing is that there is plenty of good light, only
    they don't know how to apply it. Every night, directly it
    begins to be dark, great streams of light are turned on from
    all parts of the city; but would you believe it, they are
    directed, not downwards so that they could illumine the street,
    but upwards into the empty sky! If the Chairman of our District
    Council could see this, how he would laugh! I wish you would
    tell him.</p>

    <p>Then there is coal. I went, as we arranged, first to the
    Jerusalem Hotel, but it was like ice. When I asked the hotel
    people why the central heating was not on, they said that there
    is no coal. At least it seems that there is coal, but no one to
    deliver it. Just think of our coal-merchant returning such a
    reply to us when the cellar was getting empty. But in London
    they seem to be ready to put up with any excuse. Why the men
    who ought to deliver the coals are not made to, I can't
    imagine. Anyhow, as I was freezing, I moved into lodgings,
    where there is coal, although an exorbitant price is asked for
    each scuttle.</p>

    <p>The great topic of conversation everywhere has been some new
    speculation called the War Loan, and I have to confess that as
    it is so well spoken of and is to pay the large dividend of
    5&frac14; per cent. I have arranged to invest something for
    each of us in it. I don't know who the promoter&mdash;a Mr.
    BONAR LAW&mdash;is, but it would be awful for us if he turned
    out to be a JABEZ BALFOUR in disguise. Still, nearly all
    investment is a gamble, and we can only hope for the best. He
    must have some peculiar position or the papers would not
    support his venture as they do; and there is even a campaign of
    public speakers through the country, I am told, taking his
    prospectus as their text and literally imploring the people to
    invest. Quite like the South Sea Bubble we read
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"
       id="page129"></a>[pg 129]</span> of in MACAULAY; but please
       Heaven it won't turn out to be another.</p>

    <p>I asked the landlady here about it, but she knew nothing,
    except that her family could not afford to put anything in.
    "But your daughters earn very good money," I said. "That's
    true," she replied, "but all that they have over after their
    clothes, poor girls, they spend on the theatre or the pictures;
    and I'm glad to think they can do so. I wouldn't grudge them
    their pleasures, not I."</p>

    <p>Judging by the crowded state of all the myriad places of
    entertainment in this city there are millions who are like
    them. But I couldn't help thinking that if so much money seems
    really to be needed, and this Mr. LAW is really a public
    benefactor, it might not be a bad idea to try to divert some of
    the thousands of pounds being paid every day in London alone
    for sheer amusement. Of course if England had the misfortune to
    be at war most of these places would naturally be shut up.</p>

    <p>By the way, Germans are strangely unpopular in London just
    now. I have heard numbers of people, all in different places,
    such as the Tube and omni-buses and tea-shops, using very
    strong terms about them. It has been quite a series of
    coincidences.</p>

    <h2>THE GREAT INVESTMENT.</h2>

    <p>I am a fair man, even to Huns. When Germany pays an
    indemnity of &pound;2,000,000,000 I think we might knock off a
    tenner or so because the KAISER has done so much to beautify
    our banks. Once they were cold cheerless places. A suspicion of
    an overdraft always swept through them. Now I love to go to the
    bank and see the beautiful blonde and brown and auburn heads
    bent over the ledgers. If I could be quite certain that they
    were not looking up the details of my account I should be
    perfectly happy.</p>

    <p>Somebody told me that I could buy War Loan at 5&frac14; per
    cent. by borrowing money from my bank at five per cent. This
    seemed to be the kind of investment I had been looking for. I
    found that if I took a million on those terms I should draw a
    net income of &pound;2,500 a year. But I am a patriot. It
    seemed to me that &pound;2,500 a year was rather more than I
    was worth to the nation. Was I better value than six M.P.'s? Of
    course I might be worth six RAMSAY MACDONALDS. However I
    resolved to avoid greed and ask for a simple hundred
    thousand.</p>

    <p>So I went to my bank and said to a blue-eyed, Watteau type
    of beauty, "I want to see the manager, please. Concerning an
    important investment in War Loan," I added hastily, fearing
    lest the damsel should conclude that I wanted an ordinary
    overdraft.</p>

    <p>I was ushered into the manager's private room.</p>

    <p>"About this War Loan," I began. "I understand that you
    advance money at five per cent. to make the purchase."</p>

    <p>"Yes, that is so," said the manager, beaming.</p>

    <p>I leapt for joy. I had thought that there must be a catch
    somewhere.</p>

    <p>"Put me down for a hundred thousand," I said.</p>

    <p>The manager nearly fell out of his swing-chair. "My dear
    Sir," he gasped, "have you any prospect of being able to save a
    hundred thousand during the next year or so?"</p>

    <p>"Am I a milk-dealer or a munition-worker?" I replied. "I
    should be both surprised and gratified if I saved that sum in a
    year. Still I might do it, you know. I should have to give up
    tobacco, of course. Or suppose relations hitherto unknown to me
    died and left me handsome legacies. You are always seeing these
    things in the papers. 'Baker Inherits Half-Million From Lost
    Australian Uncle.'"</p>

    You need not pay a deposit. I'll give you a form."</p>

    Well, I decline your overdraft. Keep your ill-gotten
    much-grudged gain. I'll pay cash."</p>

    <p>I left the bank sadly. I had thought of intimating to the
    blonde, brown and auburn beauties that I had just put a hundred
    thousand in War Loan. I had imagined their eyes gleaming at the
    spectacle of one-tenth of a millionaire.</p>

    <p>And now I can't go to the bank again. At least not till I
    have worked up my balance a little above its present total,

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned
    Clerks</i>.)</p>

    <p><i>If Wishes were Horses</i> (HURST AND BLACKETT) is one of
    the most engaging novels that I have met for some time. The
    matter of it, perhaps, is nothing very new: a story of
    expanding fortunes and contracting sympathies. But the writer,
    Countess BARCYNSKA, has, before all else, the inestimable gift
    of making you believe in her people. All the characters are
    vigorously alive. The result is that one follows with quite
    unusual interest the chequered career of her central figure,
    <i>Martin Leffley</i>, from his introduction as a frankly
    unpleasant youth, very red about the ears, "which was where he
    always blushed," to the final glimpse of him, titled, an M.P.,
    and, incidentally, a bowed and better man, purified by the
    wonderful devotion of <i>Rose</i>, the wife whom throughout the
    tale he has bullied and undervalued. Nor is <i>Rose</i>
    herself, with her unwavering belief in her clay idol, a less
    memorable figure. Of the others, my chief affection went to
    <i>Aunt Polly</i>, the kindly dealer in old clothes, who
    imagined the Savile to be a night club. But, as I say, the
    whole cast is astonishingly real. Only once did I fear for the
    story, when it seemed as though the machinations of a
    super-villainous M.P. were about to lead it astray into the
    paths of melodrama. But the danger proved to be brief, and the
    unexpected beauty and dignity of the closing chapter would have
    redeemed a more serious lapse.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>Forced to Fight</i> (HEINEMANN) is the record of a
    Schleswig Dane set forth by ERICH ERICHSEN and very capably
    translated from the Danish by INGEBORG LUND. It is a book that
    with a singular skill and with a passion that never gets out of
    hand so as to convey the impression of hysterical exaggeration
    lays bare the heart of a youth who was at the storming of
    Li&eacute;ge, fought in Flanders, then on the Russian Front and
    again in the Argonne, whence a shattered elbow sent him home
    broken and <i>aged</i>&mdash;that is what his chronicler
    emphasises&mdash;not by the wound, but by the long horror and
    fatigue of the successive campaigns. The poignancy of his
    sufferings lay in the fact that as a Dane he went without any
    of the great hopes and passions that inspired his German
    comrades, of whom however he speaks with no ill-will. He took
    part by order in some of the "punishments" of Belgian villages,
    loathing the savage cruelties of them and deeply convinced that
    the rape of Belgium was an inexpiable wrong which the world
    will remember to the lasting dishonour of the German name. You
    get an impression of the added horror of this War for the
    imaginative temperamental, and some pathetic pictures of all
    the suffering among simple innocent machine-driven people on
    the other side, who had no will to war and no illusions as to
    the splendour of world-dominion&mdash;a vision of desolate
    homes and countrysides empty of all but very old men.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The first lines of <i>Still Life</i> (CONSTABLE), which
    begins in "the night train from the German frontier to Paris,"
    gave me much the same impression of impossibility (was there
    ever such a train?) that I should have felt about a story that
    opened in the moon. But the shock of this was nothing to some,
    different in character, that were to follow. Frankly, I confess
    that Mr. MIDDLETON MURRY'S book has me baffled. Others perhaps
    may admire the pains lavished
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"
       id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span> by the author in analysing
       the emotions of a group of characters whose temperaments
       certainly give him every opportunity for this exercise. An
       impressionist, and impressionable, youth, whom I have
       (reluctantly) to call hero, intrigues his unpleasant way
       through the plot; first in Paris&mdash;where you may make a
       shrewd guess at his pre-occupations&mdash;then in an English
       village, to which he has eloped with the wife of a friend;
       in France again, and so on. The emotions to which these
       amorous adventures expose him are handled by the author with
       a care that suggests rather the naughtiness of the antique
       nineties than anything belonging to these more vigorous
       days. I am far from suggesting that, as a study in
       super-sensibility, the book lacks skill. There are indeed
       scenes of almost painful cleverness. My complaint is that it
       is out of date, or (I should perhaps better say)
       conspicuously out of harmony with the present time. But if
       you hanker for these pictures of the past that is another
       matter. I will merely issue a warning that you should
       preserve this book on some shelf not too accessible by those
       who are still young enough to overestimate its
       importance.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It was an odd experience to turn, as I did, directly from
    the new Haymarket play, of which the late TOM GALLON was part
    author, to what I suppose was the last story he ever wrote,
    <i>The Lady in the Black Mask</i> (MILLS AND BOON), which
    begins in a theatre with the heroine watching a play. It
    begins, moreover, very well and excitingly; much better, I
    regret to add, than it goes on. When the heroine arrived home
    from the theatre, the girl whose companion she was, pleading
    fatigue, persuaded her to go out again to a masked ball,
    wearing the dress and indeed assuming the personality of her
    mistress. The two girls, <i>Ruth</i>, the heroine, and
    <i>Damia</i>, lived in a gloomy house with old <i>Mr.
    Verinder</i>, who was <i>Damia's</i> guardian. But when
    <i>Ruth</i> returned from the ball she found that this
    arrangement no longer held good, <i>Verinder</i> having been
    melodramatically stabbed during her absence. And as no one
    knew, or would ever believe, that it was <i>Damia</i> and not
    herself who had remained at home you recognise a very pretty
    gambit of intrigue. Unfortunately, as I said above, the tension
    is not quite sustained, partly because the characters all
    behave in an increasingly foolish and improbable fashion (even
    for tales of this genre); partly because there is never
    sufficient uncertainty as to who it was (not, of course,
    <i>Damia</i>) who really killed <i>Verinder</i>. Still, of its
    kind, as the sort of shocker that used to be valued at a
    shilling, but appears, like everything else, to have risen in
    price, <i>The Lady in the Black Mask</i> is fairly up to the
    average. I fancy her profits might have been greater before the
    discouragement of railway travelling. That is precisely the
    environment for which she is best fitted.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In the series of "Chap" books which is emerging from The
    Bodley Head I have no doubt that <i>Canada Chaps</i> will be
    welcome. I hope, however, that Mrs. SIME will not mind my
    saying that the best of her tales are those which have more to
    do with Canada than its "chaps." Her stories of fighting and of
    fighters seem to me to have a note in them that does not ring
    quite true. It is just the difference between the soldier
    telling his own artless and rugged tale and someone else
    telling it for him with a touch of artifice. But when the
    author merely uses the War as her background she writes with
    real power. The straining for effect vanishes, and so little do
    the later stories resemble the earlier that I should not have
    guessed that they were written by the same hand. "Citoyenne
    Michelle" and "The King's Gift," for instance, are true gems,
    and they are offered to you at the price of paste. Nowhere will
    you find a better bargain for your shilling.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>HELEN MACKAY, in <i>A Journal of Small Things</i> (MELROSE),
    sets before us with, it might seem, almost too deliberate
    simplicity of idiom little scenes and remembered reflections of
    her days in France since the July of the terrible year. An
    American to whom France has come to be her adopted and most
    tenderly loved foster-country, she tells of little things,
    chiefly sad little things, seen in the hospitals she served or
    by the wayside or in the houses of the simple and the great,
    shadowed alike by the all-embracing desolation of the War. The
    writer has a singular power of selecting the significant
    details of an incident, and a delicate sensitiveness to beauty
    and to suffering which gives distinction to this charming book.
    Less happy perhaps and much less in the picture are the
    episodes learnt only at second hand and suggesting the
    technique and unreality of the imagined short story.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
